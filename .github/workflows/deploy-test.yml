# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Function App when a release is created.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure Function App.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-plan-manage#create-an-app-service-plan
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. For Linux apps, add an app setting called WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM and set it to true in your app **before downloading the file**.
#      For more instructions see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings
#
# 2. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE with the value of your Azure publish profile.
#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
#
# 3. Change the values for the AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME, AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables  (below).
